# Object-oriented program repository

## This repository includes the following:
-A Workshop_1 folder that includes the first workshop of the class Advanzed programming 
-A folder called Finalproject, which includes the technical report of the developed project (online store platform), the draft of the paper and the scientific poster about the project.

## About the final project Online store platform:
The project consists of the development of monolithic software for an online store.  In terms of technical decisions, the project was limited to the processes of purchasing items on the website and the appearance of the items purchased by the user within a tab called purchased items.  
Now, among the tools necessary to develop this software, and taking into account that it will be a monolith, it was decided to use Python for the development of the back-end together with the fast-api framework. For the graphical interface, it was decided to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Apache server, and Django framework. Finally, for the database, the SQLAlchemy software will be used, since it allows managing database relationships with a syntax similar to that of the programming language.

## For the developmemt of this project the following user stories were gathered:

- As a manager, I want a platform where I can publish the different products that I offer to anyone so that the number of sales increases.
- As a manager, I want an option for the buyer to log in or register if not have an account, so I can identify the buyer in the future.
- As a buyer, I want to create an account to be able to see all the purchases I made on the platform. 
- As a buyer, I want to access the main page and be able to select the product I want to buy.
- As a manager, I want the application not to show those products that are out of stock.
- As a manager, I want it to be verified at the time of payment that the user or buyer has identified themselves as a user of the application and if not, force them to identify themselves.
- As a buyer, I want to be able to purchase more than one unit of a product and be able to see the total that I need to pay.
- As a manager, I want to provide the platform with a way to search for products by name and display the searched product and similar products that may interest the buyer on the same page. 

## Develoopment process
To facilitate and organize the development of the platform, we begin by creating the UML diagrams of __Activities__, __Sequence__, __State__, __Classes__ and the corresponding __CRC__ cards of each class.
