## Second worckshop

This second workshop consists of updating the platform developed in the first workshop, for this we start for the requirements that we used in the first worchop that were the following:

- Each vehicle has at least engine, chasis(A or B), model, gas consumption, and year.
- Depending on the vehicle type, you should define additional properties.
-There are different vehicle types: car, Truck, Yacht, and Motorcycle.
- Each engine has type, potency, and weight.
- To calculate the vehicle gas consumption you could create a method based on:
`1.1 * engine.potency + 0.2* engine.weight - (0.3 if chassis ==A or 0.5 if chassis == B).`
- the platform should have a simple menu to create vehicles, review all vehicles registered

based on the new need of the client, the following requirements were added:

- To acces the platform you must have an account.
- Employees will have an account with permissions to add parts and vehicles to the platform 
- Users external to the company will only be able to search and watch vehicles
- Employees must be able to see a list of sold vehicles 

all this requirements was constructing based on the user histories that you can find in the file __technical report__ included in this folder. 

In this folder you gonna find a folder called __Diagrams__ is used to save the modeled diagrams for the proyect, these are:
- __Activity Diagrams__
- __Sequence Diagrams__  
- __Class Diagrams__
- __State Diagrams__

And you're gonna find a file called __Technical report.pdf__, which contains all the information related to the worckshop development.
